<h2>Introduction</h2>

In the WRO RoboMission exist four different categories that are: We Do, Elementary, Junior and senior. Every year the category teams design robots that solve challenges in a competition. These robots are fully autonomous to solve these challenges. 
 
For each age group a new field and mission are developed each year.  However the challeges and action that you need to do the robot are so simillar that knowing this you only need to create a good strategy and a good design of your robot to win the competition. On the day of the competition a surprise rule adds a new element to the mission. This rule is added to test the creativity of the teams and how fast they solve this new challenge. This rule is known as "The Secret Rule" but don't worry normally this rule only remove one of all the missions, for example the robot needs to complete all the challenges to the exception the red room. So you only need to modificate a little bit your code to solve this new challenge. 

<h2>Focues Area</h2>

Normally every WRO category and game has a special focus on learning with robots. So the students will focus on developing in the following areas:
 
- General coding skills and basic robotics concepts (perception of environment, control and navigation).
- General Engineering skills (building a robot that can push/lift objects of certain sizes). This area is one of the most difficult and important in the competition. 
- Developing optimal strategies to solve concrete missions. Creating a good strategic you can win easily the competition so you need to focus on this. 
- Computational thinking (e.g., thinkering, debugging, collaboration, etc).
- Technical complexity of the missions (e.g., pushing, lifting, grabbing game objects).
- Randomness of the game elements (e.g., one or multiple random situations). This is too common in the senior category so the team need to be able to solve this random situations. 
- Required accuracy of the solutions to the mission (e.g., a big target area or a small spot).

<h2>Team and Age Groups definitions</h2>

General aspect and limitation to create a team. 
 
* A team consist of 2 or 3 students (I recommended 3)
* A team is guided by a coach (to be possible if you can get a former contestant to work with him will be better because you will have someone that have a little of experience in the competition)
* Important 1 team member and 1 coach are not considered a team and cannot participate in the competition (The function of a coach only is facilitate participant learning)
* Any student may work with more than one team
* The minimum age of a coach at an international event is 18 years old.
* Unlike the students the coach may work with more than one team.
* The age groups in RoboMission competitions are:
  * Elementary: students 8-12 years old
  * Junior: students 11-15 years old
  * Senior: 14-19 years old
 
And this is a little bit of the most important aspect, the general rules of the competition making focus on the things that I considered more important. If you want to know more about the WRO rules you can obtain more information here.

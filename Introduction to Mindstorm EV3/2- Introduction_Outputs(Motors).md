<h2> Motors </h2> 

The motors in LEGO Mindstorms are our unique type of output, with the motors we can create a lot of thing since the traction of the robot or used to create a claw, etc. Important: The brick only have 4 output ports to connect our motors so for that reason if we will create a design of a robot we need to keep this in mind.  

<h2>Types of motors</h2>

- **Large motors:** This motor has a built-in rotation sensor with 1-degree resolution for precise control (Encoder). This motors usually are used to move the robot because had a lot of torque to be precise with a runs torque 20 Ncm and a stall torque of 40 Ncm. This motor is slower but really stronger.

- **Medium motors:** This motor also has a built-in rotation sensor with 1-degree resolution for precise control (Encoder). This motors usually are used in claw and in somethings that you need to move things without so much effort. But in the competitions this is so diferent because the best teams of the world take advantage of specifications of this motor to create a faster and presice robot. The Medium Motor runs at 240â€“250 rpm, with a running torque of 8 Ncm and a stall torque of 12 Ncm, It's faster but less powerful.

**Later we will talk more in depth about the encoders of these motors as it will be of great importance to perform fast and precise movements on the robot.**

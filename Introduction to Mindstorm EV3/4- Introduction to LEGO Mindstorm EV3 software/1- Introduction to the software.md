<h2> Introduction </h2> 

Ok, right now we are finished with a big part about the most important things of hardware. So Now We need to continue with the software and henceforth we will work harder on this.

The LEGO Mindstorms EV3 is programmed using the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 software, HOME or EDUCATION version. It is also programmable using LabVIEW and RobotC. Thanks to its Linux firmware and large community, LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Education can be opened to other programming languages.

EV3 Education software is more focused on the pedagogical aspect of the LEGO robot. The lobby is clear and simple. But it is in terms of content that it really stands out. EV3 Education software offers LEGO TPs directly (transaction processing system is a type of information system that collects, stores, modifies and retrieves the data transaction of an enterprise) integrated into the software. It also has a virtual assistant, who will guide you in the discovery of robotics. It offers a data editor, allowing all text data and all kinds of media to be integrated directly into the student program. Finally, the data monitoring functionalities, but also their processing (application of mathematical formulas to a curve) and export (text file or spreadsheet).

I am going to work with LEGO Mindstorm EV3 version 1.4.5. If you prefer you can perfectly use other current versions of the software, but in my case I am going to use this software version.

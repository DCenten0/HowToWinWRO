<h2> A Little bit about the hardware </h2> 

First that all we need to star is talk about the hardware. Let's start talking about the "Brick" the brick is all the microprocessor that had 4 input port (1,2,3,4) and 4 Output ports (A, B, C, D), whith the brick we can program and control the entire robot.

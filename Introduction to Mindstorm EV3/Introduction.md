<h2> A Little bit about the hardware </h2> 

First that all we need to star is talk about the hardware. Let's start talking about the "Brick" the brick is all the microprocessor that had 4 input port (1,2,3,4) and 4 Output ports (A, B, C, D), with the brick we can program and control the entire robot. The processor that the Lego Mindstorms used is an ARM9 CPU running Linux.  

The display of the brick show you all the brick interface. In this intercafe you have 4 section:
- Section One: All the last programs that you were run.
- Section two: All the directories that contain all your files of your program.
- Section three: 
- Section four: 

The display can also be programmed to show information about the sensors, the motors, numbers, strigns until you can show a happy face in the display.

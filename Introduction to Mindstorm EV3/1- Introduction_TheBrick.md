<h2> A Little bit about the hardware</h2> 

First that all we need to star is talk about the hardware. Let's start talking about the "Brick" the brick is all the microprocessor that had 4 input port (1,2,3,4) and 4 Output ports (A, B, C, D), with the brick we can program and control the entire robot. The processor that the Lego Mindstorms used is an ARM926EJ CPU running Linux.

The display of the brick show you all the brick interface. In this intercafe you have 4 section:
- Section One: All the last programs that you were run.
- Section two: All the directories that contain all your files of your program.
- Section three: This section is one of the most important and powerfull of the brick becuase we can control and monitor all the inputs and outputs that are connected in the brick using that information to create more accurancy in the movements of the robot. We will go into depth on this topic later.  
- Section four: In this section we can adjust some configuration of our brick as the volume, the time that the brick turn off if doesnt detect any action, bluetooth communication, WiFi Communication and brick Name.

The display can also be programmed to show information about the sensors, the motors, numbers, strigns until you can show a happy face in the display. The resolution of the display is 178Ã—128 pixel Monochrome LCD. 

With the brick buttons you can navegate acroos the interface and also you can to program then to star an action, finish the program, get a value, among many things.

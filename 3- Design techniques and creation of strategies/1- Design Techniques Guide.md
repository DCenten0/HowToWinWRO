<h2>Introduction</h2>

Remenber that the WRO competition is one of the most important and recognized worldwide in educational robotics, in which teams of students from different countries face each other, who must demonstrate their skills and knowledge in the construction and programming of robots.

Building robots for competitions like WRO is a great way to encourage critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration in students. In addition, it also provides them with the necessary skills to perform in fields related to robotics, automation and technology in general.

So knowing this you can see that the design of a robot is one of the most important part of all the competition and for that reason you need to create a good design of your robot for the competition.

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

In this part I going to show you a list of recommendations for create a good design of your robot:

* Use robust and stable structures to ensure that the robot is capable of withstanding the impact of the movements and tasks assigned to it. When you build your robot try to create the best robust and eficcient structure because in the competition because if a part becomes loose or lose it can drastically change the performance of the robot.

* Use powerful and efficient motors to ensure that the robot has enough strength and speed to complete the tasks of the competition. This depends to much of the challege so I recommend you read the rules well to know what type of motors are the best to complete the challege. Normally for the competition in the senior category they use the medium motor because they are faster than the large motors and you can create interesting design with this motors.
 
* Using sensors to provide the robot with information about its environment and help it navigate and perform tasks autonomously.How I said in the last recommendation this depend of the objective of the challenge. So read well the rules and discuss with your teammates about what could be the best sensors that you could use. 

* Ensuring that the robot is easy to disassemble and repair in case something goes wrong during the competition. This is to important because in the competition you will have to build your robot from scratch and you need to be avaible of build as quickly as possible. When you are in the competition you have around of one hour so if you finish your robot in less of this time you can take advanteges to go to the table and start to calibrate your robort. Doing this you could have advantage of others teams.

* Perform performance tests and debug the robot before the competition to ensure its proper functioning. Knowing the last recommendation that I said you you can to use the extra time to calibrate and debug your robot.
